      <h2>The API has since changed since writing this article, and the demo no longer works. But this should still give absolute beginners some tips and ideas for working with APIs.</h2>

      <p>
        The US National Weather Service and weather.gov is an amazing resource,
        and has an easy to use, well documented API. I really appreciate public
        resources like these and want to rework an old script of mine, so I
        decided to document and expand on their examples with by own.
      </p>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        Alrighty, let's
        <em>fetch a forecast for a given latitude and longitude</em>!
      </p>

      <h2 id="learning-api" class="gap-top">Learning about the API</h2>

      <p class="gap-bottom">
        The first step, but not so flashy step is fiddling with and learning
        about the API.
      </p>

      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <a
        class="button"
        href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api"
        >NWS API Web Service Documentation</a
      >
      <a class="button" href="https://api.weather.gov/openapi.json"
        >Open API Documentation Endpoint</a
      >
      <p class="gap-bottom">Looks great! Everything we need to be dangerous.</p>

      <h3>Accessing forecast data</h3>
      <p>Here we find the implementation details need to reach our goal.</p>
      <p>
        In the
        <a href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api"
          >Examples</a
        >
        section of the generously provided official docs, we learn that
        forecasts are provided by an <em>office</em> for a given set of
        <em>grid coordinates</em>.
      </p>
      <pre>
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{grid X},{grid Y}/forecast</pre
      >
      <p>
        The examples even go on to show how to collect that info from a given
        <em>point</em>!
      </p>
      <pre>https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}</pre>

      <p>
        From looking at sample forecast, we've got an array of objects to make
        up our forecast. Right on.
      </p>
      <pre>
{
  "number": 4,
  "name": "Monday",
  "startTime": "2020-10-26T06:00:00-05:00",
  "endTime": "2020-10-26T18:00:00-05:00",
  "isDaytime": true,
  "temperature": 26,
  "temperatureUnit": "F",
  "temperatureTrend": null,
  "windSpeed": "10 to 15 mph",
  "windDirection": "N",
  "icon": "https://api.weather.gov/icons/land/day/snow,70/snow,50?size=medium",
  "shortForecast": "Light Snow Likely",
  "detailedForecast": "Snow likely. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 26. North wind 10 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. New snow accumulation of 1 to 3 inches possible."
}</pre
      >

      <h3>User Agent</h3>
      <p>
        weather.gov wants us to use an User Agent to identify ourselves, however
        as of writing that isn't
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=571722"
          >supported in all browsers.</a
        >
      </p>

      <h2 class="gap-top">Planning</h2>
      <p>Now with some information in hand, let's state what we want to do:</p>

      <p>
        For a given <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>, use the NWS API to
        make a <em>5 day forecast</em> like you might see on TV.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm going to use a class with ES modules to organize and execute our
        code, but keep it fairly functional in case I need to reuse it in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our goal, and some knowledge of the API in hand let's sketch out
        the code:
      </p>

      <pre>
export class ForecastFetcher {
  // set defaults, merge user config in constructor

  // fetch data via the nws api

  // lookup and provide point 

  // lookup and provide forecast

  // combine point and forecast lookups

  // prepare forecast days and render template
}</pre
      >

      <h2 id="fetching" class="gap-top">Fetching data</h2>

      <p>
        We've gotta get the data from the API so let's setup a tool to query it.
        We're going to use a super simple
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"
          target="_blank"
          >fetch</a
        >
        with the GET method.
      </p>
      <p>This will definitely happen more than once, so let's abstract it.</p>

      <pre>
// fetch data via the nws api
useNWS = async (route) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${this.config.host}${route}`, {
    method: "GET",
  });

  return response.json();
};</pre
      >

      <p>Now we can make functions to request data from our two endpoints:</p>

      <pre>
// lookup and provide point information
lookupPoint = async (lat, lng) => {
  return this.useNWS(`points/${lat},${lng}`);
};

// lookup and provide forecast info
lookupForecast = async (office, gridX, gridY) => {
  return this.useNWS(`gridpoints/${office}/${gridX},${gridY}/forecast`);
};</pre
      >

      <h2 class="gap-top">Business Logic</h2>

      <p>
        Now let's take what we have, and turn it into what we need. In a highly
        used situation you would want to persist data from the first endpoint,
        but for now let's make a function to combine our class's abilities:
      </p>

      <pre>
// combine point and forecast lookups
lookupForecastForLatLng = async (lat, lng) => {
  const point = await this.lookupPoint(lat, lng);
  const { cwa, gridX, gridY } = point.properties;

  return await this.lookupForecast(cwa, gridX, gridY);
};</pre
      >

      <h2 class="gap-top">Parsing the forecast</h2>

      <p>
        The <em>properties</em> key of the response json contains an array of
        forecasts called <em>periods</em>. We need to loop over these and
        construct a forecast. There are different ways to do this but a quick
        and dirty innerHTML suits my current needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a small catch,
        <em>sometimes the first item is the current night!</em>
        We'll need to handle that edge case.
      </p>

      <pre>
// manipulate html strings, or let user do it
markupForecast = (forecast) => {
  let forecastMarkup = "";
  const { periods } = forecast.properties;

  let offset = 0;
  let maxDays = this.config.maxDays;

  if (!periods[0].isDaytime) {
    offset = 1;
    maxDays -= 1;
    forecastMarkup += this.dayRenderer({ night: periods[0] });
  }

  for (let i = offset; i < maxDays * 2; i += 2) {
    const forecastDay = {
      day: periods[i],
      night: periods[i + 1],
    };

    forecastMarkup += this.dayRenderer(forecastDay);
  }

  const forecastWrapper = document.createElement("DIV");
  forecastWrapper.innerHTML = this.wrapRenderer(forecast, forecastMarkup);
  return forecastWrapper;
};</pre
      >

      <h2 class="gap-top">Templating</h2>

      <p>
        Before the markup is inserted into the DOM, it much first be collected
        by our templating functions. We'll use template literals (``) and a
        single argument passed as an object to make this highly flexible.
      </p>
      <p>See <em>dayRenderer</em>, and <em>wrapRenderer</em> in the source.</p>

        >View Source</a
      >

      <h2 class="gap-top">And... Done!</h2>

      <p>
        Our final function returns a element ready to DOM inseration. See the
        bottom of the script for our new tool at use!
      </p>

      <pre>
// Abbreviated

(async () => {
  const demo = document.querySelector("#demo");

  // instantiate the class with our config
  const fetcher = new ForecastFetcher({
    maxDays: 5,
  });

  // Lookup forecast for lat and lng
  const forecast = await fetcher.lookupForecastForLatLng(39.7456, -97.0892);

  // mark it up and stick it in the DOM
  const forecastNode = fetcher.markupForecast(forecast);
  demo.appendChild(forecastNode);
})();
      </pre>

      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

      <h3 class="gap-top">Note</h3>
      <p>
        This all started with wanting to renovate an old hairy and scary jQuery
        script I'd wrote that parsed XML layouts from a different NWS API. It
        worked at the time but I couldn't bring that cruft forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had no ideas these endpoints existed at the time, and it just goes to
        show there's always one more article to read. Thanks to everyone whose
        work made this API public and so easy to use!
