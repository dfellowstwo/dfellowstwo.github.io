Photo by Edward Dupuy<br />Dr. and Mrs. Jack B. Fellows Lease Monte Vista,<br />Announce Plans To Operate Hotel Year Around
<p class=z80 centerText>Dr. and Mrs. Jack B. Fellows of Ridgecrest have leased the Monte Vista hotel for one year with option to purchase from the estate of the late Mrs. L. E. Phillips, it was announced today. They have assumed control of the property, including the main hotel unit, plus the annex, and the summer house annex with all equipment and furnishings. First and second floors of the main hotel unit will open Saturday with the exception of the dining room. According to present plans the hotel will operate on a year around basis in the future, Dr. Fellows revealed. The hotel has been operated in the summer only since the death of Mrs. Phillips August, 1952. Established in 1920, the Monte Vista is considered one of the finest small town resort hotels in the nation. Present plans call for the operation of the facilities as a complete hotel during the summer season. In Winter it will be operated both as a hotel, with dining room facilities, and as the headquarters for the newly established Baptist University of Creative Arts. Announcement of the establishment of the UCA was made on March 24 by Dr. Fellows through the Southern Baptist Recreation publication entitled "Directed Leisure". Sites had been visited and inspected in four states prior to the decision to locate in Black Mountain. Walter Burgess, president of the Chamber of Commerce, has worked very closely with Dr. Fellows in attempting to bring the University to this community. 
  "We believe that there is a great opportunity in this area for the operation of a hotel, and the existing facilities satisfy the requirements of our needs for the University better than anything else we have seen. It is our purpose to serve the community in every way possible as a part of the growing emphasis of a summer vacationland. At the same time it is our desire to provide the best possible service and facilities to the individuals and organizations of Black Mountain and the surrounding territory", Dr. Fellows said. Dr. Fellows was born July 22, 1918. at Springfield, Mo., the son of Mr. and Mrs. Don B. Fellows. He was educated in the public schools of Springfield and was graduated from Southwest Baptist College, Bolivar, Mo., in 1940 with an Associate of Arts. He received his B.A. from Oklahoma Baptist University, Shawnee, Okla., with honors in 1944, his Master of Religious Education in 1946 and his Doctor of Religious Education in 1948 from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas, he was voted the best all around man at Oklahoma Baptist University. He is not new in the business world. From 1942-1944, Dr. Fellows was advertising manager of Sears-Roebuck at Shawnee, Okla., and is at present president of Fel'crest Enterprises, Inc., a firm which publishes books and periodicals and the manufacture and distribution of hobby and craft supplies; president of Twentieth Century Research, Inc., established in 1951 to aid church and civic groups in promoting a program to curb delinquency; vice-president of Airway Radio, Inc.; editor of Directed Leisure, a bi-monthly recreation periodical which is sent to 26 states; and president of the newly established Baptist University of Creative Arts. In addition Dr. Fellows has served as minister of education of some of the South's largest Baptist churches, Travis Avenue, Fort Worth, and Houston, Texas, First Baptist. For four years he was professor of religious education administrative at the Central Baptist Theological Seminary at Kansas City. From 1948 through 1953 he was supervisor of recreation and leisure activities at the Ridgecrest Baptist assembly. Author and co-author of 11 books, Dr. Fellows directed "Operation Prayerlift" in conjunction with Don McNeil of the Breakfast Club, ABC network show. More than 25,000 letters were received and delivered to the wounded in Korea and Japan. He has served as technical advisor in 1951 for the production of two moving pictures in Korea.

  <h4>University Of Creative Arts Begins Session </h4>
<p class=z80 centerText>The University of Creative Arts opened for the fall session at the Monte Vista Wednesday morning, Sept. 8. Planned for the past eight years by Dr. and Mrs. Jack B. Fellows, the University provides a training program for those who are responsible for leadership in Christian recreation, sports and playground activities, arts, crafts, hobbies, music, radio, and television as they relate to church, school and community problems. Opening of the University will in no way interfere with the operation of the Monte Vista as a hotel, Dr. Fellows pointed out "We will continue to receive and to serve guests on an overnight or seasonal basis" he explained. Dr. and Mrs. Fellows have had wide experience and training as recreation directors. They have planned and promoted programs at many churches throughout the South and Southwest. As part of their training here students at the University will be taken on a tour and will have an opportunity to work in the field and do the type of work for which they are being trained. Dr. Fellows holds degrees from Southwest Baptist College, Bolivar, Mo., Oklahoma Baptist University, and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He has served as minister of education at some of the South's largest Baptist churches. For four years he was professor of religious education administrative at the Central Baptist Theological Seminary at Kansas City. He is author and co-author of 11 books. Mrs. Fellows is a graduate of Southwest Baptist College, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. The curriculum is divided into two sections. The first provides a thirty-six week course of study for college graduates. Half of the time will be spent in Black Mountain and the remainder will be included in an eighteen week tour in twelve states. A Masters of Creative Arts degree will be granted upon completion of the thirty-six week course. Only fifteen to twenty-five students will be accepted each year. The second phase of training will offer courses for those in this area who are responsible for this type work in schools, churches and community programs. There will be both day and night courses. A small fee will be charged to cover the cost of instruction. Detailed lists of subjects and when they will be offered will be mailed free to those who write for them. The purpose of the training program is to provide trained leadership for the segment of each persons daily life when he is not eating, sleeping, working, or worshiping. The present trend toward shorter working hours, better working conditions, modern improvements in the home which provide more leisure for the housewife, or the high cost of living which necessitates both members of the home to seek employment, has called for an advanced program for both the church, school and community. It is not the purpose of the University training program just to provide for the teenagers. A children's program has also been instituted. Thirty-five children make up the register of the kindergarten and first grade which opened in the hotel last Wednesday. A fully graded and accredited academy is being formulated so that the University students will have all ages of children to work with in the training program. Fifteen to twenty-five retired couples are being invited to join the HOBBY COOPERATIVE to be housed in the Monte Vista. A couple may join the cooperative for a small fee and live in the hotel. They will have access to the complete craft and hobby department of the University and will be taught to do things with their hands, or will be given an outlet for abilities if they already have acquired skills in making items for sale. A distributing system has been worked out so that the things made will be placed in gift shops in this and other tourist areas. The University students will also work with this group. A younger adult program is also being planned for this group in the general area. There will be monthly features of interest to church and civic groups. Weekly bingo games, monthly table and equipment games will be featured. A fountain has been installed in the recreation room of the hotel. Many groups will have their banquets and parties with students of the University directing these activities. <a href="https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn96086030/1954-09-09/ed-1/seq-1/#words=B+Dr+Fellows+Jack+Mrs">LINK</a></p>

<details><summary>Dr. Jack Fellows is Injured January 6th, 1955</summary>
<h4>Dr. Jack Fellows is Injured Near N. Wilkesboro</h4>
<p class="centerText z80">Dr. Jack B. Fellows, manager of the Monte Vista hotel, was injured between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. last Thursday when the truck with which he was pulling a heavy trailer stalled on a mountain road north of North Wilkesboro and both plunged down a steep incline. Trapped in the truck Dr. Fellows managed to crawl out through the broken windshield while a truck driver, who saw the accident, had gone for help. He was rushed to the Wilkes county hospital for X-rays and observation. He is expecting to be released soon. No broken bones were found. The accident occurred on highway 18, approximately 18 miles north of North Wilkesboro. While Dr. Fellows was shifting from second to low gear the truck motor stalled and the brakes failed to hold. The heavy house trailer jerked loose from the truck and plunged more than 150 feet down a steep incline. The truck followed and smashed head on into the wrecked trailer. Dr. Fellows was knocked unconscious but regained consciousness while a truck driver was attempting to open the doors, which were jammed. While the driver went for help, Dr. Fellows crawled out of the truck, it is believed, through the smashed windshield. Wreckers removed the truck Thursday night and the trailer Friday morning. Both were badly damaged. <a href="https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn96086030/1955-01-13/ed-1/seq-1/#words=Dr+Fellows+Jack">LINK</a>
