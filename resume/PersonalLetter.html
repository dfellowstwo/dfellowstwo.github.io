<p>Honest people pay a premium to have me in their life.</p>
<p>My mother had 18 years of marriage, three healthy children, and a husband with a broken back before I was born.</p>
<p>Instead of honoring her vows she had two more children and raised us to fill in the gaps in her life. </p>
<p>It all worked out in the end. Mom lived two months past her prognosis. She died the first time I missed eating a meal with her. I don't wake up as often scared my dad is going to lay a hand on me. </p>
<p>What I want:</p>
<ol>
  <li>	Love</li>
  <li>Good looking, 34, big tits, healthy child, 10,000 acres of navel organges, pecans, and honeybees in Southern California who begs me to give her a child.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I will settle for:</p>
<ol>
  <li>	Love</li>
</ol>
<p>When she was dying she wanted to see my dad. <br>
</p>
<p>When my dad and I got to the nursing home parking lot he called the police        and my dad, the police and I sat in the parking lot until I gave        up and took my dad home. <br>
</p>
<p>My mother died the day I missed eating all her meals with her.        She lived two months past her prognosis.<br>
</p>
<p>My dad has been dead 12 years and I still occasionally wake in        the middle of the night scared he is going to lay his hand on me.</p>
<p>I was sorry to read about Ken. I liked him. You should have had        more time together. He was a good person and a good father. How        are you?</p>
<p>It is a testament to Ken's good character that he welcomed me        into his home. You are lucky to have Angel's children close by. I        am sure they are a comfort to you. I have nothing but fond        memories of being invited into your home. Thank you.<br>
</p>
<p>We are who we are. I am sorry to contact you under these circumstances.<br>
</p>
<p>I am filling out an application for work. It requires an essay on        my accomplishments and the phone numbers of the people who can        verify what I say. 64 years and all I have are two people who know        me and one of them I have not spoken to since 1968. Is Colleen's        phone still 202-244-2046? One of my accomplishments is ushering at        the National Presbyterian Church and I would like Colleen to        verify that.</p>
<p>I hope you are well.</p>

<p>Hi Keith, my name is Doug Fellows. <br>
  <br>
  I read your Craigslist ad, e-Commerce Manager wanted. <br>
  <br>
  I will and can do what ever has to be done. <br>
  <br>
Work the sales floor, refurbish appliances or part out an appliance and sell it on ebay, I can do it.</p>
<p> I owned my own business.  I have my own tools. I have parted   out appliances before. I build custom shipping   boxes.</p>
<p>I am moving to Traverse City to be near my   brother Dr. Neal Fellows and his wife, Deborah. <br>
  <br>
  I have sold on ebay since 1999. This is my ebay feedback. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="ebayfeedback.jpg" width="690" height="2124" alt="screenshot of ebay feedback"><br>
  <br>
  From 2013 to 2019 I worked for <a href="http://dfellows.rf.gd/resume/livebolivar.html">livebolivar.com</a>, a property rental /   management company. AJ Ellis, the owner, will be happy to talk to you.   <a href="tel:14173273911">417-327-3911</a> M-F 9-5 Central Time. <br>
  <br>
  I was responsible for designing and maintaining a website to lease ~56   homes and ~100 apartments. I wrote all the code, created all the   content, wrote the descriptions, shot the video, created the slideshows   and took the photos. I was responsible for buying appliance parts   online, repairing the appliances and helping AJ repair properties. I   have looked up part numbers for washers, dryers, dishwashers,   refrigerators, ovens, .... Every appliance in the home. <br>
  <br>
  I do not have any active ebay listings I can show you but I do have two   Craigslist Ads: <br>

<p>Should I remove or use the following?</p>
<p>The last repair   I did was a washing machine transmission drive shaft. If the machine is old, If you can find a   good machinist he can spray weld the corrosion caused by  bleach and   hot water at a profitable cost and sell the machine for more than you will get parting it out. </p>

WORKSHOP MICROWAVE OVEN. USED SHARP R-410LW 1100W

Workshop microwave oven. Heat you materials the safe way


Windows server for public administrators (not technicians), powershell, html, css, php, MySQL, javascript, Git, linux, Node, Sass, Apache.



I started my bachelors degree in 1975. My father got a PhD and nearly a second one without going into debt; My mother a Masters. 

I would finish my Bachelors if I could do it without going into debt and I could study:

Windows server for public administrators (not technicians), powershell, html, css, php, MySQL, javascript, Git, linux, Node, Sass, Apache.

In short, Web Development.




I prefer to work while I study.


I have applied for 30 jobs from Alaska to South Carolina and New Hampshire to Hawaii. A friend says 


I want to pick out and train one of your local boys to test milk and mix forage for you, someone who will do it for the rest of his life.



If your girlfriend is a good person just throw this out. 

I envy you getting up at 4AM every day to earn a living

I am a retired traveling salesman and I have to leave every summer and get slapped a few times to get my girlfriend  to be nice to me.

My girlfriend has a heart of stone and I have to leave every summer and get slaped a few times just to get her to be nice to me. 

Does your girlfriend have a heart of stone?


I want to warn you.

I am a big city boy who was born in a small town.

When I was a kid I used to climb up the TV antenna pole and sit on top of the house.

Can you settle a bet for me? 

My girlfriend says you’re a small scale operation using outdated equipment that cares more about loyalty than product purity and is looking for a local boy to do their milk testing and forage mixing.

I say you’re a first tier large scale commercial dairy farm using mostly brand new equipment, that puts purity above all else and is as honest as the day is long.




My name is Douglas Rae Fellows. I am a retired traveling salesman, website designer, and a student of Dr. Samuel J. Perlmutter, deceased, Chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies, Gaithersburg, Maryland. He came to teach at our school when he was forced into retirement due to his age. I got straight A's in his class for two years and went on to study chemistry at the University of Maryland, College Park. I still use what he taught me to this day.

I was born at the Haywood County hospital, Waynesville, North   Carolina, USA Sunday, June 30th, 1957. I would like to work for you.






 first job I interviewed for was as a lab technician. Your ad is forcing me to make an assumption, are you looking for somebody to milk cows, somebody to analyze milk or both?

If given time I will tell this story well.

You have to remember these three things:

No one ever told me to have money or someone who loved me at the end and there's not a single bad apple in this family of 16 adults.

Today I asked my sister why no one ever told me, she didn't answer.

When I tried to force my dying father to see his dying wife in the nursing home he called the police.

And Grappone automotive told me to walk, bike, run or kayak to the dealership.









I would like to work for you.

Find me something to do , I do not want to marry a wealthy ascetic.

Cycle Alaska is looking to hire a full-time, year-round operations manager who is passionate about the outdoors, loves providing excellent customer experiences, and enjoys learning new things. 

This job has many moving parts. For example, you might be receiving and logging in a bike order one moment and the next, helping a kid accessorize their very first bike. Flexibility is key! The perfect candidate has a positive attitude, knows how to prioritize thinking of the customer first, is willing to jump in and learn, is detailed, and strives always to provide stellar customer service.

About Us: 
Cycle Alaska is a full-service bike and tour company. We have been a part of the Juneau community for over 24 years. We pride ourselves on giving exceptional service and experiences while creating customers for life! We also take great pride in our team members and our work. Our team is one of our most important assets. And Cycle Alaska is always looking for opportunities to get our community out riding bikes. 

We are open year-round for sales, rentals, repairs, and accessories. And, during the summer, we also offer bike tours to guests who visit Juneau independently and on cruise ships.

Cycle Alaska is proud to have been named one of America's Best Bike Shops by the National Bike Dealers Association 6 years in a row! 

Now let's talk about you! 
You are excited about the outdoors and pride yourself on providing outstanding customer experiences. You keep calm in hectic situations, have a positive attitude, and are willing to be flexible. 

Previous experience in a supervisory position is preferred. We also have a few computer programs to learn, so being unafraid to learn new software and having some technical know-how will be essential. 

Now for the technical stuff: 
We require you to have at least six years of driving experience and a clean driving record for at least the last three years for our insurance. Bikes can sometimes be heavy, and we would like you to have the ability to lift around 55lbs occasionally. Not sure how to change a bike tire or what a bike chain looks like? That is no problem; we can teach you. We are looking for the right fit for our fantastic team.

Benefits: 
Where you work and whom you work with is vital! We have a stellar team and have an excellent reputation in the community. We provide healthcare reimbursement, a bonus program, vacation days, and of course, bike and accessory discounts! Did we mention free lunch on Saturdays?

Does this sound like a good fit? Sweet! Please send a cover letter explaining why you would be a great fit, along with your resume.

<p> I would like to get an A in your INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT (HEBREW BIBLE) (RLST 145)
  
  I could build a home with you as 25% of the foundation if you still profess: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo-YL-lv3RY">18:31</a> brought me comfort:
  
  "Job, possibly the greatest book of the Bible, 
  I won't give away my preferences there, 
  challenges conventional religious piety and arrives at 
  the bittersweet conclusion that there is no justice in this 
  world or any other, but that nonetheless we're not 
  excused from the thankless and perhaps ultimately meaningless 
  task of righteous living."
  
  I need a group of like minded fellows.

  Do you still believe what you said?

<p>This probably will not work out but nothing ventured nothing gained.</p>
<p>I sold tropical house plants in a 1500 square-foot retail space in suburban Washington, DC for 15 years. We owned three green houses. We traveled to Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico to buy plants and supplies. I had a garden in Washington, DC for 10 years. I grew gladiolas, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and more.</p>
<p>I would consider it an honor to work for you and very much look forward to helping you in your work. No training necessary on weed wacker, chainsaw or any other tool. I would very much enjoy the work you are offering.</p>
<p>Here are some pics of my current house plants. Most of them started as cuttings.</p>
<p>dfellows.rf.gd/resume</p>
<p>Looking for temporary full time work. Employment contingent upon securing housing within six miles of the garden. I will commute by bicycle. I would prefer 4AM to Noon shift to start. This application is a fallback in case my applications for tech work do not come through. Two months guaranteed employment will pay for my travel.</p>
<p>  Thank you for placing this ad. You have a nice day.</p>

<p> I am going to start by replying to your ad from the bottom up.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Include an example of your passion for helping people using technology
    <ol>
      <li>An employer that asks this is not focused on business. I will be making a significant financial investment to join you. I will be packing up my house, moving ~1000 miles, and establishing a house in Myrtle Beach. I would hate to get there just to see you being locked out of your offices because you are thinking of passion instead of business.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Why am I seeking this opportunity? 
    <ol>
      <li>I am smart enough to know you have a good idea and dumb enough to know that I could not write the code that will unlock one, and only one, hotel room door in a city with 10,000 hotel room doors and do it 10,000 times a day without failing. I hope you never get that much market penetration. I would not want to go to a city where there was not a person that had a financial stake in correctly answering the question, "Where is a good place to eat?" </li>
      <li>You will succeed. Your application has a place.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
        <p>My last employer will be happy to talk to you. He knows nothing about technology except that he likes telling people he has a website.</p>
      <p>I am a self-taught full stack developer. In my resume you will see a link to my last project, a property management website for ~56 homes and ~100 apartments. I wrote all the code, created all the content (markup, video, slide show, photos, graphics,...), managed the back end, when I got tired of writing code would join the owner in doing property maintenance and I did it for six years. I wrote their application page that asked what type of property they where looking for, accepted application payment, upload of drivers license and emailed everyone the results in php. You can stop laughing now.</p>
      <ol>
          <li> Your ad from the top down:
            <ol>

              <li>I want to work with exceptional people, grow, and be a part.</li>
              <li>Can communicate clearly and effectively, both oral and written.</li>
              <li>Troubleshoot and problem solve. Who can't?</li>
              <li>I prefer to start 4AM to Noon. In time I can transition to 9 to 5. I can work remotely.</li>
              <li>I would do my job better if my phone and email support could also be done from a company provided smartphone.</li>

I am under qualified but well traveled. I thought I was a talented full stack developer. I would like to see just how far software engineering has surpassed me. Your craigslist ad is excellent. Who would not want to work for you. I would like to be the administrative assistant, at one time or another, of all the people in charge of the people developing software. Take a look at my personal website http://dfellows.rf.gd and contact me if you are interested.

  <p>I am writing in response to your Craigslist ad: <br>

    <br>

    IT Administrator <a href="https://kalispell.craigslist.org/sof/d/kalispell-it-administrator/7323502220.html">https://kalispell.craigslist.org/sof/d/kalispell-it-administrator/7323502220.html</a> <br>

  </p>

  <p>To formulate a response to your ad I need some more information        if you please.<br>

  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>Excluding cell phones is LC Staffing exclusively running          Microsoft Windows 10 Professional?</li>

    <li>Does LC Staffing use 3rd party proprietary software to          generate your "find a job" / "find a hire" data and is that data          stored online with the 3rd party?</li>

    <li>If so what is the name and version of the software and what is          the url of the company's website?<br>

    </li>

    <li>If not:</li>

    <ol>

      <li>What tool / tools / product / products does LC Staffing use            to generate your "find a job" / "find a hire" data?</li>

      <li>Give me a worse case workflow of successfully matching one            employee with one employer?</li>

    </ol>

  </ol>

  <p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I am writing in response to your Craigslist ad: </p>

<p>IT Administrator https://kalispell.craigslist.org/sof/d/kalispell-it-administrator/7323502220.html </p>

<p>You asked I contact Heidi but since this is a position of security I am contacting you.  </p>

<p>Your ad is incomplete. I am going to make some assumptions and make an ass out of you and me. </p>

<ol>

  <li> All employees of LC Staffing / Kalispell access your network via a device / devices running Windows 10 Professional installed on the device. Or device / devices running Android or iOS. No Apple products except cell phone. </li>

  <li>All other employees of LC Staffing access your product via the internet. </li>

  <li>Microsoft Windows Server, any version, is not running on any PC at any office.</li>

  <li>Your network hardware is in a secure, locked, restricted access room in LC Staffing / Kalispell.</li>

  <li>Your foremost concern is the survival of the information you and your employees generate on a given day:

    <ol>

      <li>A database / spreadsheet / document of &quot;need a job&quot;/ &quot;need a hire&quot;.      </li>

      <li>You use a native Microsoft product ( access, excel, word) to do this.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>

<li>You backup that information in three places:

    <ol>

      <li>An encrypted flash drive you carry on your person.</li>

      <li>The Kalispell office on an offline server.</li>

      <li>Michigan. On a server that is physically located in the eleventh largest city.</li>

    </ol>

</li>

<li>Antivirus software is not installed.</li>

<li>You want all PCs to function on a daily basis.</li>

</ol>

<p>End of Assumptions. </p>

<p>I am an ass if:</p>

<ol>

  <li>You use 3rd party proprietary software to generate your &quot;need a job&quot; / &quot;hire a job&quot; and that product is stored online.</li>

</ol>

<p>All product generated by you should be physically accessible by you at all times. 3rd party online storage can not be relied upon. It should not be used as the primary source of backup / access. How do you generate your product?</p>

<p>Disruption to your business happens four ways.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Theft and sabotage:

    <ol>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by having an offline server in a secure room and having backup stored at multiple locations.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>

  <li>Incompetence:

    <ol>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by restricting what websites employees of LC Staffing can access.</li>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by switching to web mail only.</li>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by restricting web mail to your most competent non IT administrator employee.</li>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by limiting all employees, except your IT administrator, to (Standard / User) rights / privileges.</li>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by restricting physical access to your network hardware to your IT administrator only. All servers, routers, modems, and uninterrupted power supplies should be in a locked secure room.</li>

    </ol>

</li>

  <li>Accident

    <ol>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by storing a copy in multiple locations.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>

  <li>Natural disaster

    <ol>

      <li>Disruption is reduced by storing a copy of your information in Michigan.  </li>

    </ol>

  </li>

</ol>

<p>Keeping in mind the assumptions made above I will now response to your listed responsibilites:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Easy

    <ol>

      <li>Monitoring and maintaining networks and servers.</li>

      <li>        Upgrading, installing and configuring new hardware and software to meet company objectives.</li>

      <li>        Implementing security protocols and procedures to prevent potential threats.

        <ol>

          <li>Properly setting up a Windows PC network reduces the chance that your network will be captured by ransonware. I have created my own procedure to defeat ransonware attacks based around the software product PrettyGoodPrivacy.</li>

        </ol>

      </li>

      <li> Creating user accounts and performing access control.

        <ol>

          <li>No one gets adminstrator rights / privileges.</li>

        </ol>

      </li>

      <li>Performing diagnostic tests and debugging procedures to optimize computer systems.</li>

      <li>Documenting processes, as well as backing up and archiving data.</li>

      <li>Developing data retrieval and recovery procedures.</li>

      <li>Designing and implementing efficient end-user feedback and error reporting systems. </li>

      <li>Providing IT support for cloud-based software platforms and VOIP system.</li>

      <li>        Keeping up to date with advancements and best practices in IT administration. </li>

    </ol>

  </li>

</ol>

<p>I did all this for livebolivar.com for six years. They are a two person, one office, property management company in Bolivar, MO. You can call AJ Ellis at 417-327-3911 M-F 9-5 Central Time to confirm that. I never explained to him what I was doing. He will not be able to comment on what I call Easy. The ads I have responded to ask: Why did you leave your employment? I was accused of damaging property and my employer refused to stand up for me.</p>

<p>Because I do not have a degree I will take less.</p>

<ol>

  <li>You are offering ~$4583 / month.</li>

  <li>I will take $3583 / month with a one month minimum and a two week notice.</li>

</ol>

<p> I can start in a week. I love Kalispell and would like to return to it. I will not provide my own transportation if traveling on company business.</p>
