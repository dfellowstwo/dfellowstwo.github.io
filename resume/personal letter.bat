This letter is in response to your craigslist ad IT Administrator https://kalispell.craigslist.org/sof/d/kalispell-it-administrator/7323502220.html You asked that I contact Heidi but since this is a matter of security I am contacting you. Your ad was incomplete. I have to start off by making some assumptions, making an ass of you and me. You use a Microsoft product / products ( Word, Excel, Access ) to match employees with employers. Protecting those files is easy. Damage to a computer network has three vectors: an employee intensionally damages the network,
Kristen Heck has 31 employees. How to stop those employees from stealing your list of employees / employers either purposely or by damaging it.

I would like to be Sarah Palins White House Chief of Staff. My father got one PhD and nearly another without going into debt. With the advent of the internet teachers are redundant.

dfellows.rf.gd/resume

Temporary Seasonal Full Time Front Desk Night Shift. My preferred guests are employees of the astronautics industry followed by doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, clergy and entertainers who are not fuck ups. Bruno Mars, Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Tom Hanks, Jason Bateman, Green Day, Pink Floyd, Andy Woodhull, and Christine Hayes comes to mind.

First round trip ticket SGF to TLV gets my service. Can start in one week. Have two doses Moderna Covid-19 April 1, 2021. Will move north as season progresses, Vienna,  London, ... if you have hotels there. My USA passport is valid till 20 April 2022.

I only speak English. The United States is the greatest country in the history of the world. I do not like the American idea of a hotel. To me a hotel is not a home away from home; it is my home. You are a guest in my home. You are expected to leave it better than you found it. I prefer the night shift to start. I prefer room and board as part of my compensation but it is not a deal breaker. The closest I came to working in a hotel is when my father signed a contract to lease and operate the Monte Vista Hotel in Black Mountain, North Carolina April 1954 http://dfellows.rf.gd/images/pics/pics4. I will need an advance to buy three suits when I get there. I prefer Churchill shoes but welcome your advice.

The west has been sold a bill of goods; I want to be in Israel when the shit hits the fan. When they write the next Bible I can keep you from getting a black eye for another 2000 years. Do I want to work for you? No. I want to marry a good 34 year old big titted white girl who loves me, who has a healthy daugther, owns 10000 acres of navel oranges, pecans and honeybees in Southern California and begs me to give her a child.

May God bless you and your great country.

Dear Sir or Madam,  I am applying for the position of Locate Technician. I ride my bike 18 miles a day and just today I was told I have the health of a 30 year old. I graduated from Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, MD with a 3.42 GPA and attended the University of Maryland, College Park where I majored in Chemistry, my favorite class was Calculus, and I received an A for an architectural drawing I did of the United States Capitol. I have a clean background and driving record, am safe, and do not do drugs and look forward to living in Kalispell. I meet or exceed all the requirements in your ad: Independent, mark, document, smartphone, emergencies, overtime and weekend. I have a valid drivers license and I own a pair of White's boots.

I have a clean background and driving record, am safe, do not do drugs, will get my right of way herbicide application license and I ride my bike 18 miles a day. Here is the rub: To do it for the rest of my life? God I hope not. I will leave my story here.
