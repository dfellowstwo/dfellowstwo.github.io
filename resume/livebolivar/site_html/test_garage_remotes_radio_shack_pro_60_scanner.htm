SETTING THE VOLUME AND SQUELCH

1.  Turn SQUELCH fully clockwise.

2.  Turn VOLUME OFF/MAX clockwise to about half way.  The scanner turns
    off.

3.  Turn SQUELCH counterclockwise until you hear a hissing noise.

4.  Adjust VOLUME OFF/MAX to a comfortable level.

5.  Slowly turn SQUELCH clockwise until the hissing noise stops.

NOTES:  If squelch is set too low, the scanner can pick up unwanted or weak
        transmissions.  When this happens, slightly turn SQUELCH clockwise
        to decrease the scanner's sensitivity to weaker signals.

        If squelch is set too high, the scanner might not pick up any
        transmissions.  When this happens, slightly turn SQUELCH counter-
        clockwise to increase the scanner's sensitivity.

SEARCHING FOR AND TEMPORARILY STORING ACTIVE FREQUENCIES

You can set your scanner to search for:

    Transmissions within a limited range of specified frequencies
    (limit search).

    Transmissions starting from a designated frequency (direct search).

When the scanner finds an active frequency, you can quickly store it in
one of the 10 monitor memories.

NOTE:  Your scanner rounds down the entered frequency to the nearest valid
       frequency.  For example, if you try to enter 151.473, the scanner
       accepts it as 151.470.

During a limit search, the scanner searches upward starting from a selected
lower frequency limit, or downward starting from a selected upper frequency
limit.

1.  Press PGM, then LIMIT.  Lo appears on the display.

2.  Enter the lowest frequency in the desired frequency search range, then
    press ENTER.

3.  Press LIMIT, Hi appears on the display.

4.  Enter the highest frequency in the desired frequency search range,
    then press ENTER.

5.  To search up or down:

    One step (5, 12.5, or 50 kHz) at a time - quickly press and release up
    or down.

    Continuously, until the scanner finds an active frequency - press and
    hold up or down for about a second.

    - L - and SRCH appear on the display, an indicator flashes under the
    next available monitor memory, and the scanner searches through the
    specified frequency range either upward (from the lowest selected
    frequency), or downward (from the highest selected frequency).

    NOTE:  While searching either upward or downward, when the scanner
           reaches a specified limit (either upper or lower), it
           automatically skips to the starting frequency and continues
           searching.

6.  When the scanner stops on an active frequency, you can either:

    Press MON to store it in the next available monitor memory, or

    Press and hold UP or DOWN for about a second to continue the search.

7.  To stop continuous searching, while UP or DOWN SRCH appears on the
    display, press UP or DOWN until the UP or DOWN symbol disappears.

DIRECT SEARCH

During a direct search, the scanner searches upward or downward, starting
from a specified frequency or stored channel.

NOTE:  "PRIORITY" must be turned OFF in order to start a "Direct Search".

1.  To start a direct search from a specified frequency:

    a.  Press PGM.

    b.  Enter the desired frequency.

    NOTE:  Do not omit digits (except the last zeros) after the decimal
           point.  The frequency must be fully entered for the scanner to
           start the direct search.

    c.  Press DIRECT.

    To start a direct search from a stored channel:

    a.  Press MANUAL or PGM.

    b.  Enter the desired channel number.

    c.  Press MANUAL or PGM again.

    d.  Press DIRECT.

2.  To search up or down:

    One step (5, 12.5, 25, or 50 kHz) at a time starting from the specified
    frequency or channel - quickly press and release up or down.

    Continuously until the scanner finds an active frequency - press
    and hold up or down for about a second.

    - d - and SRCH appear on the display, an indicator flashes under the
    next available monitor memory, and the scanner searches either upward
    or downward starting from the selected frequency.

    NOTES:  While searching either upward or downward, when the scanner:

            Reaches the end of a band, it automatically skips to the
            beginning of the next available band.

            Reaches the end of the last available band, it automatically
            skips to the beginning of the first.

3.  When the scanner stops on an active frequency, you can:

    Press MON to store it in the next available monitor memory, or

    Press and hold UP or DOWN for about a second to continue the search.

4.  To stop continuous searching, while UP or DOWN SRCH appears on the
    display, press UP or DOWN until UP or DOWN disappears.

LISTENING TO A MONITOR MEMORY

To listen to a monitor memory, press MANUAL, MON, then the number key of
the desired monitor memory.

NOTE:  You cannot scan monitor memories.

STORING FREQUENCIES INTO CHANNELS

Your scanner has 10 channel storage banks, each with 20 storage areas
called channels, where you can permanently store a total of 200
frequencies.  You can either move a monitor memory to a channel, or you
can manually enter a frequency to store it.

Moving a Frequency from a Monitor Memory to a Channel

Follow these steps to move a monitor memory to a channel.

1.  Press MANUAL, enter the channel number you want to store frequency in,
    then press PGM.

2.  Press MON, then enter the number of the monitor memory that has the
    frequency you want to store into the channel.

3.  Press ENTER.  The scanner stores the frequency into the selected
    channel.

Manually Storing Frequencies into Channels

Good reference for active frequencies are Radio Shack's "Police Call Radio
Guide Including Fire and Emergency Services," "Official Aeronautical
Frequency Directory," and "Maritime Frequency Directory."  We update these
directories every year, so be sure to get a current copy.  See also "Guide
to the Action Bands" in the manual.

Follow these steps to manually store a frequency into a channel.

1.  Press MANUAL. MAN appears on the display.

2.  Enter a channel number then press PGM.  The selected channel number
    and PGM appear on the display.

3.  To enter a frequency, enter the first digits (up to 3), press symbol,
    enter the last digits (up to 4) then ENTER.

For example, to enter the frequency 166 MHz:

You Press                                 You See

MANUAL                 (NN)CH             000.0000 MAN

8                      (NN)CH             8

PGM                    8CH                000,0000

166                    8CH                166

[.]                    8CH                166.

000                    8CH                166.000

ENTER                  8CH                166.0000 FM

NOTES:  The scanner continuously monitors the most recently stored channel.

        ERROR appears on the display when you enter a frequency not with-
        in the scanner's bands (see "Specifications").  To erase an error,
        press CLEAR then repeat Step 3.

4.  To program the next channel in sequence, press PGM and repeat Step 3.

NOTE:  To change the direction it sequences in, press UP or DOWN before
       you press PGM.

       To program more channels in any sequence, repeat Steps 2 and 3.

SCANNING THE STORED CHANNELS

1.  Press UP or DOWN to select the scan direction.

    NOTE:  When you first turn on the scanner, the scan direction is always
           UP.

2.  Press SCAN.

The scanner scans through all non-locked channels in the activated banks
(see "Turning Channel-Storage Banks On and Off" and "Locking Out a
Channel").

NOTE:  If the scanner does not scan, re-adjust SQUELCH.

TURNING CHANNEL-STORAGE BANKS ON AND OFF

A more efficient way to scan is to turn off storage banks you do not want
to scan.  For example, if you wanted to scan only current police activity,
you would not want the scanner to scan, find, and waste time monitoring
channels in other banks that did not include police frequencies,  Instead,
you can turn off the other nine channel-storage banks.

While scanning, press the number key for the bank you want to turn on or
off.  The bank indicator turns on or off.

If the bank indicator is on, the scanner scans all channels within that
bank that are not individually locked out (see "Locking Out a Channel").
If the indicator is off, the scanner does not scan any of the 20 channels
within that bank.

NOTES:  You can manually select any channel in a bank, even if the bank is
        turned off.

        You cannot turn off all banks.  At least one bank must always
        be active.

MANUALLY SELECTING A CHANNEL/FREQUENCY

Selecting a Channel

You can continuously monitor a specific channel without scanning.  This is
useful if you want to hear a broadcast on a channel and do not want to miss
any details (even though there might be periods of silence) or if you want
to monitor a locked-out channel (see "Locking Out a Channel").

If the scanner is stopped at a channel you want to continue listening to,
quickly press MANUAL once before it continues scanning again.

NOTES:  Pressing MANUAL additional times makes the scanner step through
        the channels.

        To change the channel step direction, press UP or DOWN before you
        press MANUAL additional times.

If the scanner is scanning:

1.  Press MANUAL to stop the scanning.

2.  Enter the desired channel number

3.  Press MANUAL again.

If the scanner is not scanning, enter the desired channel number then
press MANUAL.

Selecting a Frequency

You can manually select a desired frequency.  This is useful if you want
to monitor a frequency you have not stored, or a frequency stored in a
locked-out channel (see "Locking Out a Channel").

1.  If the scanner is scanning, press MANUAL to stop the scanning.

2.  Enter the desired frequency.

3.  Press DIRECT.  The scanner continuously monitors the selected
    frequency.

USING PRIORITY

The priority feature lets you scan through the programmed channels, and
still not miss an important or interesting call on a designated channel.
To use the priority feature, you need to designate a stored channel first
and then turn the priority feature on.

Designating a Channel

1.  Press PGM.

2.  Enter the desired channel number.

NOTES:  You can designate any stored channel as the priority channel, but
        you can have only one priority channel at a time.

        To "undesignate" a priority channel, either designate another
        channel or turn the priority feature off.

3.  Press PRI.

Turning the Priority Feature On/Off

To turn on the priority feature, press PRI during scanning.  PRI appears
on the display.  The scanner checks the priority channel every 2 seconds
and stays on the channel if there is activity.  P appears to the left
of the display whenever the scanner monitors the priority channel.

To turn off the priority feature, press PRI.  PRI disappears from the
display.

USING DELAY

Many agencies use a two-way radio system that might have a pause between a
query and a reply.  To avoid missing a reply, you can program a 2-second
delay into a channel or a frequency.  When your scanner stops on a channel
or frequency with a programmed delay, it continues to monitor it for 2
seconds after every transmission before the scanner resumes scanning or
searching.

To program a 2-second delay:

If the scanner is in the scan mode and stopped on the desired channel,
quickly press DELAY before it continues scanning again.  DLY appears on
the display.

If the scanner is not stopped on the desired channel, manually select the
desired channel, then press DELAY, DLY appears on the display.

If the scanner is in the search mode, press DELAY. DLY appears on the
display and the scanner programs a 2-second delay into all the frequencies
it finds.

To turn off the 2-second delay on any channel or frequency, press DELAY
while the scanner is monitoring the channel or frequency. DLY disappears
from the display.

LOCKING OUT A CHANNEL

You can scan channels faster by locking out specific channels you do not
want to monitor, such as a continuously active weather channel.

1.  Press MANUAL. MAN appears on the display.

2.  Enter the desired channel number.

3.  Press MANUAL again.

4.  Press L/OUT so L/O appears on the display.

When it scans, the scanner skips the locked out channel.

NOTES:  There must be at least one active channel in each bank.  You
        cannot lock out all channels.

You can still manually select locked-out channels.

To unlock a channel, manually select the channel then press L/OUT so
L/O disappears from the display.

USING THE LIGHT

While the scanner is on, press LIGHT to light the display for 5 seconds.
Press any key other than LIGHT while the backlight is on to keep the
display lit for another 5 seconds.  To turn off the backlight before it
automatically turns off, press LIGHT.

TURNING THE KEY TONE ON/OFF

Each time you press any of the scanner's keys a tone sounds to verify that
the scanner has correctly accepted your entry.

To turn the scanner's key tone on or off, first turn off the scanner.  Then
while you press and hold 2 and ENTER, turn VOLUME OFF/MAX clockwise until
the display appears.

USING THE KEYLOCK

Once you program your scanner, you can protect it from accidental program
changes by sliding KEYLOCK to the right.

The only controls that operate in the keylock mode are SCAN, MANUAL, LIGHT,
VOLUME, and SQUELCH.  When you want to change the scanner's programming,
slide KEYLOCK to the left.

CHANGING THE AM/FM/WFM RECEIVE MODE

The scanner scans in the following modes:

   AM (amplitude modulation) -            Used in aircraft bands and
                                          amateur radio band.

   FM (narrowband frequency modulation) - Used in action bands such as
                                          police, fire, ambulance, amateur
                                          radio, etc.

   WFM (wideband frequency modulation) -  Used in commercial FM broadcasts
                                          and television sound.

The scanner is preset to the most common AM/FM/WFM receive mode for each
frequency range.  The preset modes are:


FREQUENCY BAND (MHz)                                RECEIVE MODE

30.0000 - 87.4950                                     FM

87.50000 - 107.9500                                  WFM

108.0000 - 136.9750                                   AM

137.0000 - 224.9950                                   FM

225.0000 - 399.9875                                   AM

400.0000 - 512.000                                    FM

760.0000 - 999.9875                                   FM

The preset mode is correct in most cases.  However, some ham radio and
military aircraft broadcasts do not operate in the preset mode.  If you try
to listen to a broadcast when the scanner is not set to the correct receive
mode, the broadcast might sound weak or distorted.

To change the mode, press AM/FM/WFM.  AM, FM, or WFM blinks on the display
to indicate that the displayed receive mode has been changed from the
preset mode.

NOTES:  If you change any frequency band's receive mode during a limit or
        direct search, the scanner no longer uses any of the preset receive
        modes.  Instead, the scanner searches for frequencies in all the
        bands in the selected mode.

        If you change the band mode to WFM during frequency search, your
        scanner automatically searches frequencies at 50 kHz steps.

To return to the default settings, press and hold down CLEAR then press
AM/FM/WFM.

For more information, see "Specified Intervals" under "A General Guide to
Scanning."

A GENERAL GUIDE TO SCANNING

Reception of the frequencies covered by your scanner is mainly "line-of-
sight."  This means you usually cannot hear stations that are beyond the
horizon.

During the summer months, you might be able to hear stations in the 30-50
MHz range located several hundred or even thousands of miles away.  This
is because of summer atmosphere conditions.  This type of reception is
unpredictable but often very interesting!
