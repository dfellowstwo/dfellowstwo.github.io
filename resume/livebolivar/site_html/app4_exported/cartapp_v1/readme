This folder contains scripts that are shared with Shopping Cart + new files that constitute
a more generalized api.

All files in the php... folders are the ones used by SCC. 

The folder that roots this folder must be part of the include path. Files can best be
included like this:
	cartapp/phphosted/file_name.ext
	cartapp/api/...

FormBuilder has added a version number to the cartapp folder name, thus use:
	cartapp.1/phphosted/file_name.ext
	cartapp.1/api/...
