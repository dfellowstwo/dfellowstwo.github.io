			<p>I am a Southern Baptist Democrat.</p>
			
			<p>I had a private tour of the United States White House in 1968. I used my first computer in 1969. I wrote Fortran at the University of Maryland, College Park where I majored in Chemistry, my favorite class was Calculus, and I received an A for an architectural drawing I did of the United States Capitol in 1975. For the next 17 years I owned my own business, started teaching myself to become a full stack software engineer and refurbished computers for donation to a school for children in Croatia. From 1992 to 2007 I ushered at the National Presbyterian Church, Washington, DC, whose members / attendees included President of United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Warren E. Burger, whose funeral service I ushered, Senator John Glenn, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, my parents Dr. and Mrs. J. Beverly Fellows, who are interred there, and my wife Colleen Flynn to name just a few. In 2007 I followed my parents to Missouri and cared for them till their death in 2009. For the next ~10 years I concluded teaching myself how to become a full stack software engineer and worked for AJ Ellis <a href='tel:14173273911'>417-327-3911</a> M-F 10-5 <?php if (date('I', time())) {echo 'Central DST';} else {echo 'CST';}?>, a property manager, buying parts and supplies, doing repairs, remodeling houses and designing and developing his website <a href=56.html>livebolivar.com</a></p>
